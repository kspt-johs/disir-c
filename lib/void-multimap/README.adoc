= void-multimap

A non-type checked void hashmap that accepts multiple unique values per input key.
Iterating a key is done by querying the multimap for a `multimap_value_iterator`, which
you can iterate by calling `multimap_iterator_next()` on the iterator.

== Build and Test

Make a `build` folder in the root of the project. Navigate to it and issue the cmake command.
----
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
----

Run test by issuing the following command in your build folder. The tests require
the CMocka C library installed.
----
$ make test
----

To get verbose output if a test fails, use
----
$ ctest -V
----

== Documentation

You can view the API reference documentation link:doc/multimap_8h.adoc[here].

To build the documentation from your build folder, we require

* Doxygen
* Doxml2AsciiDoc (submoduled) (Ruby)
* Asciidoctor (HTML output only) (Ruby)
----
$ make doc
